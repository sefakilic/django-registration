* django-registration

This is a fairly simple user-registration application for Django,
designed to make allowing user signups as painless as possible. It
requires a functional installation of Django 1.4 or newer, but has no
other dependencies.

For installation instructions, see the file "INSTALL" in this directory. Full
documentation is available online https://django-registration.readthedocs.org/

Different from the original one, this application asks for first and last names of
the user, in addition to the username, email and password.
